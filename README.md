#My personal Powershell scripts

Get-Onedrive-Direct-Link - converts a regular Onedrive share link into a direct download link

youtube-dl - calls youtube-dl, asks for the url input, saves the file in $home\Videos

youtube-dl-audio - same as above but converts the video into mp3 and saves it to $home\Music
